1. Uniswap is an automated liquidity protocol powered by a constant product formula and implemented in a system of non-upgradeable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

2. Each Uniswap smart contract, or pair, manages a liquidity pool made up of reserves of two ERC-20 tokens.

3. Anyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for pool tokens. These tokens track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves, and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.

4. Pairs act as automated market makers, standing ready to accept one token for the other as long as the “constant product” formula is preserved.
