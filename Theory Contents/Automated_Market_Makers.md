# Automated Market Maker

An automated market maker (AMM) allows digital assets to be bought and sold automatically at market price on a decentralized exchange (DEX), without an intermediary. This can happen with liquidity from a liquidity pool on an AMM, where trades are secured by smart contracts on a peer-to-contract basis.
